# My LeetCode Journey
![LeetCode Stats](https://leetcard.jacoblin.cool/mohamedemirhajji?theme=dark&font=Paytone%20One&ext=heatmap)

In this GitHub repository, I will document my experience as I tackle LeetCode challenges, beginning from the very basics. My objective is to establish a solid groundwork in problem-solving and algorithms, while progressively enhancing my programming abilities. Each commit will showcase my advancements, insights, and solutions, and I aspire for this repository to function as both a personal archive and a valuable resource for others pursuing a similar journey.
